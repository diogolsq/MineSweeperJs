## Background

Quick sunday project for creating a game of MineSweeper to play in the browser, is based on Windows Classic Game with the same name. 
This is the version 1.0.1;

### To ADD ###

This game is not over, is already playable but lacks some a little things to polish even more, like adding a timer to each and every match and  opening automatically all the near cells that have no bomb, instead of having to click on them.
